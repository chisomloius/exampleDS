# TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset
Movies are a great source of entertainment for many people. Movie lovers like to know more than just the screen time shown them on the public movies. 

## Introduction
As Data Scientist that loves movies and yes also we also love data. I have decided to ask very some questions on movies and get the answers using the TMDB dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv). 

## Questions
With the datasets we will be exploring some deep questions and giving answers based on the data available on this notebook as follows:
- Does the budget and revenue of movie affect vote_average (viewers_rating)
- Does the runtime of the movieaffect the vote_average (viewers_rating)
- What are the average revenue of the 5000 movies
Other metrics we will measure are
- Top ten revenue generating movie
- Least ten revenue expensive movie
